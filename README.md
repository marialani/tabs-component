## Architectural Choices

A components folder with each individual component imported into the main file (App.js)

As there will only one page/no need for a router I opted not to create a pages directory. If there were more than 1 page the App.js file would be the application's router containing imported pages from a pages folder.

Given more time for testing I'd add either a folder in the root named tests with file names such as 'component-name'.test.js or create sub folders for each component which contain the component and its corrosponding tests.

There is an index.css file for base styling and a css reset for all elements. Otherwise, I am using CSS in JS in the form of styled components to isolate desired styling to each component, allow for prop based logic and for ease of updating relevant styles.

## Accessibility

100% accessibility result using lighthouse

- Where appropriate there are semantic HTML tags
- Page contains a header and heading element, headings are sequential
- Contrast ratio is sufficient
- All buttons and links have an accessible name
- Document has a relevant title
  html lang attribute specified
- Content is scalable for the user

## Supported Browsers

By default, the project generated by create-react app supports all modern browsers. Support for Internet Explorer 9, 10, and 11 requires [polyfills](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/supported-browsers-features/)

## No Javascript

To ensure the site works without JS could use a static site generator such as Gatsby or Next

## Test coverage

Given more time, I'd complete a robust suite of tests for all components

## Reusability

In terms of CSS I'd create a theme using styled components and some core styled components that can be used as well as extended by props, e.g. a flexbox container component.

React components are modular and reusable

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
